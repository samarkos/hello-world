# hello-world
Getting started with GitHub

Trying to learn some stuff and do some developing. Why not?
Already know a bit of JavaScript, and a bit less of HTML and CSS.
Had a quick course about HTML and CSS that opened my mind about visualizing layouts by boxifying.
Still clueless about back end developing. Intending to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
I believe that what I already know about simple programming logic and the data structure of JS will give me a head start.
