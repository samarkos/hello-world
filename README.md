Getting started with GitHub

Trying to learn some stuff and do some developing. Why not?
Already know a bit of JavaScript, and a bit less of HTML and CSS.
Had a quick course about HTML and CSS that opened my mind about visualizing layouts by boxifying.
Still clueless about back end developing. Intending to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
I believe that what I already know about simple programming logic and the data structure of JS will give me a head start.

As of June/2016 I am trying to understand how Git and GitHub actually work. It's not that simple.
Excited about the Meteor platform for developing apps. Studying tutorials and simple examples. Found some interesting online books.
